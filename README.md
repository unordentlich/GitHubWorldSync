# GitHubWorldSync
Synchronize your Minecraft worlds with a GitHub repository to protect the state of your worlds from loss through convenient version histories and a secure infrastructure.  🌍⇢☁


### Getting Started ✨
To use the plugin on a 1.18.2 Minecraft server, first download it via the latest workflow run or compile it yourself.

> **⚠ Caution** GitHub doesn't grow on trees either, so there are severe [file size limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github). This plugin is intended for smaller and more scalable worlds. You should therefore consider beforehand whether your intended use would exceed the limits of GitHub.

Once the plugin is on the server, restart it.
Configure everything in the plugin's directory by editing the `config.yml` file.


### Usage 🔧
##### Command
`/push` · Pushes the world to the configured GitHub repository


##### Required permissions

`server-sided op` or `worldSync.push`

### Disclaimer ⚠
This project was created for our own needs within a short period of time. Not all error cases were sufficiently covered and the logic of the plug-in was not thought through in depth.
Errors and improvements are welcome in the form of issues and pull requests, but will not necessarily be considered in the near future.
